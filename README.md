# Plate Calculator

This is a simple application made with React Native that calculates what plates you should place on the barbell given a certain weight in lbs.

My first version of this app can be found here https://github.com/AlexMNet/weight-calculator and is a web app version only using JS and CSS

Since I actually used the previous version for every workout I do, which is deployed with github-pages, I decided to make a mobile version since I use it on my phone.

I thought this would be a fun simple project that would help me learn React-Native and also just continue to learn react in generally.

If you have any questions or suggestions feel free to reach out to me. Thank you!
